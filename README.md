# “Zelda”: the Open Week bot 🤖

“Zelda” is a simple automatic responder bot that welcomes and guides students during their visit to the [*Open Week* at the University of Urbino, Italy](https://www.uniurb.it/universitaaperta) (approx. 3 days in February, each year).

The bot is driven by a set of QR&nbsp;Codes installed in various points where visiting students will probably walk through.
Each QR&nbsp;Code identifies a specific location through a *deep link* to the bot, which triggers a conversation and—possibly—delivers a quiz question.

The bot also handled a public channel with statistics for each day and can generate a daily leaderboard.
